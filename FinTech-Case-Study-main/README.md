# The Apple Card's Impact on Transactions and Payments 

---

## Overview and Origin

---

In a three-way partnership with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard, Apple launched their release of the Apple Card in the summer of 2019, setting out to penetrate and disrupt the payment industry. The Apple Card was built on the idea of making personal finance easier to manage and understand while also simplifying the transaction process and making it more secure. Apple's partnership with Goldman Sachs provides the customer a lending bank, which has issued $10 billion in credit to over 3.1 million Americans (Silver). Their alliance with Mastercard exposes Apple to the multi-trillion dollar business of digital wallets by bypassing the limitations of Apple Pay's acceptance with merchants and providing customers with Apple Card universal access (Silver).

## Business Activities:

Primarily focused for users with Apple devices and Apple pay, the Apple Card seeks to establish new norms and trends within the payment industry starting from the application process and the security of transactions to customer spending insight and transparency of payments. By making the application process completely virtual and expedient, once customers are approved, they can begin using the Apple Card instantly instead of waiting to receive their credit card (Apple Newsroom). The Apple Card has also introduced advances in the safety of customer's credit card data and in the security of their transactions. By implementing Face ID and Touch ID technology, transactions are processed and verified based on the users biometric information. For transactions that cannot be processed virtually and require a physical card, Apple card generates a unique card number on the customer's iPhone and is stored in Apple Pay's special security chip called Secure Element and creates a one-time security code for physical transactions (Apple Newsroom). The physical card does not contain any compromising information such as the credit card number, CVV security code, or the expiration date. All transactions are authorized and accessible using the customer's biometric information. The Apple Card also implements machine learning and Apple Maps to categorize and label transactions, offering customers detailed insights and summaries on their spending habits and trends. Customers are also offered clear payment options that calculate and forewarn the amount of interest that will be implemented in each payment range and encouraged to reduce their interest payments through flexible payment schedules (Apple Newsroom). The Apple Card has also introduced and eliminated many fees such as the no annual, late, international, and the over-the-limit fee. This allows Apple to offer and provide competitively low interest rates without penalizing the customer for any missed payments (Apple Newsroom).

## Landscape:

---

While Apple is nested in consumer electronics, they have used many of their advances and innovations within the field to expand their application and reach into neighboring industries such as healthcare, education, and, with the Apple Card, the payment industry. With the Apple Card's introduction into the payment industry, Apple has started to challenge many of the largest companies in the domain such as American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Discover, Capital One, and Bank of America (Shevlin). Over the years, the payment industry has moved from using magnetic strips to secure, validate, and approve transactions to chips. They have implemented computer algorithms that are not only used to detect and identify fraud, but to also identify and categorize transactions and offer competitive rewards and points to customers based on their purchases. Now with the Apple Card, transactions are secured using customer biometrics. The customer's financial spending and understanding is improved through Machine Learning and Apple Maps categorizing and labeling transactions and providing key financial insights and trends into customer spending.

## Results

---

The Apple Card's impact in the payment industry was almost immediate. Since its inception in 2019, the Apple Card has generated over 3.1 Million customers, allowing Goldman Sachs to issue  $10 billion in credit, which they had $736 million in loan balances just three months after the release of the card. Many traditional credit card issuers and large banks have seen their customers consider the Apple Card as their primary credit card. Additionally, many competing credit card issuers have seen Apple Card attract their customer base in a very significant way. Bank of America, which 22.1% of Americans have an issued credit card, have seen 28.6% of their customers now hold an Apple Card. Similarly, American Express, which 20.3% of Americans have an issued credit card have seen 34.3% of their customers now hold an Apple Card. JPMorgan Chase and Capital One have also seen their customers actively pursue an Apple Card as well. About 14.3% of JPMorgan Chase and Capital One's customers have an issued Apple Card, with 21.3% and 34.3% of Americans possessing a credit card from each respective institution (Shevlin). On top of this, roughly 6 out of 10 customers consider the Apple Card their primary credit card as opposed to competing cards from Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Capital One (Shevlin).

## Recommendations

---

While the Apple Card has driven many improvements into the payment industry, improvements in the card's ability for joint and shared usage use can still be improved. For now, Apple Card does not have the capacity to allow multiple members to store, access, and use the card (Potuck). The ability for joint or shared accounts would allow many families to extend usage of the card to their children, familiarizing them with Apple not only as a technological service but also a payment method. Familiarity with Apple as a payment service is only the start of joint and shared accounts. By allowing multiple users, especially younger generations, access to a line of credit, this can help create and instil financial responsibility. Parents would be allowed to virtually issue credit to their children, which Apple can categorize and analyze to examine their spending habits and implement methods of promoting financial education and responsibility. The most accessible way for Apple to implement such a service would be through their iCloud Family Sharing (Potuck). By using their Family Sharing technology, Apple can limit the parents, or Card holder, priority in sharing the card information and also receive notifications on all transactions and purchases made on the card. The Family Sharing capacity would allow for joint and shared accounts to be implemented and transactions to occur with secured family biometrics.
